# aws-terraform-s3

This module builds a s3 bucket with varying options.  
It will not do s3 origin, which is in another module.

## Basic Usage

```HCL
module "s3" {
  source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-s3//?ref=v0.12.3"

  bucket_acl                                 = "private"
  bucket_logging                             = false
  environment                                = "Development"
  lifecycle_enabled                          = true
  name                                       = "${random_string.s3_rstring.result}-example-s3-bucket"
  noncurrent_version_expiration_days         = "425"
  noncurrent_version_transition_glacier_days = "60"
  noncurrent_version_transition_ia_days      = "30"
  object_expiration_days                     = "425"
  transition_to_glacier_days                 = "60"
  transition_to_ia_days                      = "30"
  versioning                                 = true
  website                                    = true
  website_error                              = "error.html"
  website_index                              = "index.html"

  tags = {
    RightSaid = "Fred"
    LeftSaid  = "George"
  }
}
```

## Terraform 0.12 upgrade

Several changes were required while adding terraform 0.12 compatibility.  The following changes should be  
made when upgrading from a previous release to version 0.12.0 or higher.

### Module variables

The following module variables were updated to better meet current Rackspace style guides:

- `bucket_name` -> `name`
- `kms_master_key_id` -> `kms_key_id`
- `bucket_tags` -> `tags`

## Requirements

|------|---------|
| terraform | >= 0.12 |
| aws | >= 2.7.0 |

## Providers

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| aws | >= 2.7.0 |

## Modules
